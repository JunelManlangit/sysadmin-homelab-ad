# Organizational Unit (OU) Structure  
Author: **Junel**

This document describes the organizational unit (OU) structure used in my Active Directory home lab.  
The OU layout is designed to mimic a real-world environment with proper separation of departments, policies, and administrative boundaries.

# 1. OU Structure Overview

The following OU hierarchy was created under the domain **domain.local**:

```
domain.local
│
├── IT
├── HR
├── Finance
├── Sales
└── TestOU
```

Each OU is intended for grouping users, computers, or testing policies.

# 2. Purpose of Each OU

### **IT**
Used for:
- IT staff accounts  
- Elevated permissions  
- Testing admin-level GPOs  
- Storing scripts or service accounts  

### **HR**
Used for:
- HR employee accounts  
- GPO rules such as restricted access  
- Folder permissions for sensitive data  

### **Finance**
Used for:
- Finance staff  
- File share permission management  
- Testing access-based enumeration  

### **Sales**
Used for:
- Sales representatives  
- Basic workstation permissions  
- Light GPO configurations  

### **TestOU**
Used for:
- Testing new users  
- Testing GPOs safely  
- PowerShell automation scripts (bulk user creation)  
- Experimenting with permissions and login restrictions  

This OU is intentionally isolated to avoid affecting other departments.

# 3. Distinguished Names (DNs)

These are the exact Distinguished Names used in the lab:

```
OU=IT,DC=domain,DC=local
OU=HR,DC=domain,DC=local
OU=Finance,DC=domain,DC=local
OU=Sales,DC=domain,DC=local
OU=TestOU,DC=domain,DC=local
```

PowerShell scripts use these DN paths when creating users.

# 4. OU Creation Steps

Created using **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**:

1. Right-click **domain.local**
2. Select **New → Organizational Unit**
3. Enter OU name (e.g., "IT")
4. Repeat for each department
5. Confirm "Protect container from accidental deletion" is checked

### ✔ PowerShell verification
